# App deploying 
# 1. Clone branch `master`:  
   ```bash
   git clone -b master https://github.com/hurtki/shop-mini-app.git
   cd mini-app-tg-shop
   ```

# 2. Create `.env` with this variablesf:

``` python
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY="your key" # secret django key

DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=127.0.0.1,localhost,[::1]

POSTGRES_USER=django_user        # Username for PostgreSQL

POSTGRES_PASSWORD=1234           # password for PostgreSQL

POSTGRES_DB=django_db            # Name if database

DB_HOST=postgres                 # name of the sevice of database ( DONT CHANGE !!! )

DB_PORT=5432                    # port of database
```

# 3. Docker-Compose, containers building
### No SSL certificate deploy

 ```bash
 docker compose -f docker-compose.nossl.yml up --build -d
 ```

### SSL Certificate deploy 

 ```bash
 docker compose up --build -d
 ```
 #### Getting SSL Certificate
 - The DNS A record of your domain or subdomain must point to the IP of your server
 - Then run:
 ```sh
 docker run --rm \
  -v $(pwd)/certbot/conf:/etc/letsencrypt \
  -v $(pwd)/certbot/www:/var/www/certbot \
  certbot/certbot certonly \
  --webroot \
  --webroot-path=/var/www/certbot \
  --email you@example.com \
  --agree-tos \
  --no-eff-email \
  -d example.com -d www.example.com
```
- **you need to replace `you@example.com` with mail, the notifications about expiring certificate will go there**
- **you need to replace `example.com` and `www.example.com` with your domain**

### DEV deploy 

 ```bash
 docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build -d
 ```

# 4. After Containers started, build static files and make migrations from django container shell:

 ```bash
 docker exec -it --user root tg-shop-django sh
 python manage.py migrate
 python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
 exit
 ```


# Dev Deploying information

| Component | Dev Environment                                              | Production Environment                                            | Purpose / Why?                                                                                           |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ports     | Ports like 8000 (Django) and 6379 (Redis) are exposed outside | Only ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) are exposed; internal ports are closed | In dev, exposing ports helps with debugging and direct access; in production, minimizing exposed ports improves security and mimics real-world setup |
| Nginx     | Uses lightweight config without SSL (e.g., `tg-shop.dev.conf`) | Uses full SSL-enabled config with certbot integration             | Simplifies dev setup by skipping HTTPS; production requires HTTPS for security and trustworthiness     |
| Certbot   | Not included                                                 | Included as a separate service to manage SSL certificates         | SSL certificates are unnecessary in dev but essential in production for encrypted communication         |
| Redis     | Port 6379 exposed for easy external access and debugging     | Redis runs internally, no ports exposed externally                | Exposing Redis port in dev allows use of GUI tools and easier troubleshooting; production hides Redis for security |
| Volumes   | Local directories for static files, media, and logs are mounted to allow live updates | Same local mounts plus additional volumes for certbot SSL files   | Allows instant code and asset changes without rebuilding containers in dev; in production also persists SSL certificates and logs |
